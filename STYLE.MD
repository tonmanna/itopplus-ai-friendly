## AI Prompt for Website Enhancement:

I want to revamp my website's CSS to create a vibrant and playful 'crayon color' theme. The goal is to make the site visually engaging and colorful, utilizing CSS animations and transitions throughout all scenes.

**Key requirements:**

1.  **Color Palette:** Implement a color scheme reminiscent of a box of crayons. Please suggest a palette of 8-12 distinct, bright, and cheerful crayon-like colors (e.g., Crayon Red, Canary Yellow, Sky Blue, Jungle Green, Carnation Pink, Vivid Violet, etc.). Provide hex codes for these colors.
2.  **CSS Decoration:**
    - Apply these crayon colors thoughtfully across different elements (backgrounds, text, borders, buttons, etc.).
    - Suggest ways to make elements look "decorated" in a crayon style. For example, borders that look like crayon strokes, or textured backgrounds.
3.  **CSS Animations & Transitions:**
    - Implement subtle and delightful animations and transitions on **all scenes/pages** and interactive elements (e.g., hover effects on buttons and links, page load animations, element scroll-in effects).
    - Animations should be smooth and enhance the user experience without being distracting or overwhelming.
    - Suggest specific animation types that would fit the crayon theme (e.g., a "drawing" effect for elements appearing, a slight "wobble" or "jiggle" on hover like a child's drawing, color transitions that mimic shading with a crayon).
4.  **Overall Feel:** The website should feel fun, creative, energetic, and inviting.

**Please provide:**

- Specific CSS code examples where possible.
- Suggestions for font pairings that would complement a crayon theme.
- Tips on how to ensure the animations are performant and don't negatively impact site speed.
- Guidance on how to apply these styles globally and also target specific elements if needed.

Essentially, transform my current website into a colorful, animated, crayon-themed experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally sound.
